# Tiger

**Tiger** is a programming language introduced by Andrew Appel in his [_Modern Compiler Implementation_](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/) books. It is intended for practicing some techiniques commonly found when implementing a compiler.

Tiger is documented in Appel's books, in special in the Appendix A. The Tiger Language Reference Manual can also be found at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2002/w4115/tiger.pdf.


## Lexical analysis

This repository contains a preliminary version of a lexical analyser for the Tiger language. It is missing some lexical rules, though.

The project uses [ocamllex](https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/lexyacc.html) to generate the lexical analyser. The type to represent the tokens is generated by [menhir](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/).

The student should complete the definition of the **lexical rules** for the source language. See the language reference manual for details of the lexical structure of the language.

The missing lexical rules should be added to the file [`lib/lexer.mll`](lib/lexer.mll), which is the input used by the lexical analyser generator.

Any new terminal symbol (token) should be declared in [`lib/parser.mly`](lib/parser.mly), which is the input grammar used by the parser generator.

All tests in [`lib/test_lexer.ml`](lib/test_lexer.ml) should succeed.

You should also write documentation for the following points:
- how you handle comments;
- how you handle strings;
- error handling;
- end-of-file handling;
- other interesting features of your lexer.

When reading the Tiger Language Reference Manual, pay particular attention to the paragraphs with the headings **Identifiers**, **Comments**, **Integer literal**, and **String literal**.

The reserved words of the language are: `while`, `for`, `to`, `break`, `let`, `in`, `end`, `function`, `var`, `type`, `array`, `if`, `then`, `else`, `do`, `of` and `nil`.

The punctuation symbols used in the language are: `,` `:` `;` `(` `)` `[` `]` `{` `}` `.` `+` `-` `*` `/` `=` `<>` `<` `<=` `>` `>=` `&` `|` `:=`

The string value that you return for a string literal should have all the escape sequences translated into their meanings.

There are no negative integer literals; return two separate tokens for `-32`, for instance.

Detect unclosed comments (at end of file) and unclosed strings.
